  <p><i>Hello and welcome to a realistic journey to becoming a full stack web developer.
      <br>
      <br>
      I am a 27 year old who has made a few websites in Squarespace. I have zero knowledge of coding so Wix or Squarespace
      were the only options at the moment. To behonest, I really enjoyed making websites in the mentioned builders, but every time I started designing a page
      I got extremely frustrated.
      <br>
      Wix offers so many options, but is slow as a snail, and Squarespace on the other hand...so many limitations! You have to put image block here, you can't put it there,
      you can't change the size, can't make a vertical line...
      <br>
      In those moments of darkness I would tell to myself, ok Anna, just learn Wordpress already...everybody is using it, you can do it...So I would head to Wordpress, and bam!
      To install the plug-ins for codeless designing, I have to pay yearly subscription!
      <br>
      Thank you Wordpress but apparently you are not aware of the fact that today
      I'm making a fashion blog, but in two months I'll make a page about Formula 1 WAGs. I don't want to commit to a page for a whole year!
      <br>
      Having seen my struggles, my husband (a programmer of course) suggested
      buying a course from Udemy and learning how to make my own website from scratch.
      <br>
      And since I like a good challenge, I thought - why not. Maybe it will be fun (I was subsequently informed that it will not, in fact, be fun!)
      So tag along if you would like to see my ups and downs (mostly downs), or if you like to watch other people cry,
      because apparently, according to the fellow (future) colleagues in the industry, I will cry. A lot.
      <br>
      <br>
      If you would like to become a full-stack developer as well, take a look at the Udemy course that I will be following
      called <strong><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp</a></strong>
      by Dr. Angela Yu.
      <br>
      <br>
      I plan to design and update my Homepage as I move along with the course, but keep all the original code and design
      in the separate pages.
      <br>
      That means that when you click on HTML 5 hyperlink, you will be taken to the original page I made
      while I was following the course. I don't want to change or update those pages because I think it will be fun to see the progress (if there's going to be any at all).
      Cheers
